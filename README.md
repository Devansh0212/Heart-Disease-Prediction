## Dataset

The dataset contains information on various health metrics of patients. Each entry represents a patient and includes several features related to heart disease risk factors.

### Data Dictionary
- **age**: Age in years
- **sex**: Sex (1 = male, 0 = female)
- **cp**: Chest pain type (0-3)
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure in mm Hg
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
- **restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exang**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- **ca**: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3)
- **thal**: Thalassemia stress test result
- **target**: Target variable (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease)

## Results

The project evaluates multiple models and provides performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
